This project is made to work like a real website with front and backend scripts

Back End
	Make sure to start up the backend 1st by running backEnd.py 

Front End
	Next the front end can be opened using directly with the VS 'live server' extension
	 (to use right click main.html them click "open with live surver")

note: when using 'live server' do NOT open front end and back end as one folder in VS!!!
